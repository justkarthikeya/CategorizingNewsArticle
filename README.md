This is a Machine Learning project which will categorize the news articles.

For this I used Navie Bayes algorithm to train the model.

Also used an interesting technique Count Vectorizer to arrange the data in the form of array.

For this project I collected the dataset from Kaggle.

Raw dataset and the code for the project is uploaded in the repositary.
